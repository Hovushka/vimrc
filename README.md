# .vimrc
My `~/.vimrc` and `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` file. The first one has some Mac-specific setting that can be easily removed. Both support NeoVim, but the latter requires NeoVim 0.5 features.

# Usage
You need to install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) manually beforehand, as well as neovim API packages for NodeJS and Python. Then:

1) Copy the file to your system.
2) Run Vim.

# DISCLAIMER
If you've come here from any of [these posts](https://habr.com/ru/users/hovushka/posts/), search for the relevant version of the config in the commit history.
