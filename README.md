# vimrc
My `~/.vimrc` file. It has some Mac-specific setting that can be easily removed.
# usage
1) Copy the file to your system
2) Run Vim
3) Manually compile YCM

   E.g. `(cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe && python3 install.py --clang-completer)`
* you can install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) manually beforehand
